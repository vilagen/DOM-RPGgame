# unit-4-game

Thank you for playing my Street Fighter RPG! 

In this game you start by choosing from 1 of 4 characters.

Each character has their own stats:

HP: If health goes to 0, the fighter is defeated. That includes you.
Attack: The player's attack power.
Counter-Attack: The opponent's attack power.

The goal is to choose a fighter and defeat the other three. 

While it may seem like 3 on 1 is a big disadvantage, there is one other stat.

Attack-Boost: How much the player's attack increases each turn.

After teach turn, each character's attack power will raise. 

Try to choose the correct characters with lower counter-attack power to 
build up your own attack stat.

To start a fight, first choose your character. Then choose the first opponent
you wish to challenge. Then the "Fight" button will appear. Click the button
to attack the opponent.
